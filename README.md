# simpleblog
The simplest possible blog framework that one can develop

This may not be true, but it's pretty darn close.

Features:
* A homepage with cropped text
* A post page without cropped text
* Upvoting
* An editor which allows new posts and editing of old posts (only title and post content)
* Hookup to a noSQL backend (preferably a document based JSON tree)
* Pulls posts from blob storage
* Simple styling


All React. All beautiful.
